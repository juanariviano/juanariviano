### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Juan, a Computer Science student at **Binus University** in Indonesia.  

Iâ€™m passionate about **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Web Development**. Iâ€™ve built projects ranging from AI-powered chatbots to donation platforms and computer vision systems. I love working on impactful software that connects technology with real-world solutions.  

Some of my notable projects include:  
- ðŸ¤– **DiagnoAI** â€“ a chatbot that predicts heart disease using ML models (Decision Tree, KNN, SVM).  
- ðŸ’¤ **Drowsiness Detection** â€“ a YOLOv11s-based model for real-time monitoring.  
- ðŸŒ± **Donation Platform** â€“ connecting donors, volunteers, and events for environmental causes.  

Outside of studies, I enjoy following new developments in science and technology.
